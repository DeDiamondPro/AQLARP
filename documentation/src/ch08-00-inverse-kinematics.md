# Inverse Kinematics
In this chapter we will look at the calculations behind the inverse kinematics of AQLARP. These calculations are based on trigonometry since it is quite easy to split all these problems into triangles.
If you are not familiar with this topic or want more info, I would recommend watching the video below as it does a great job explaining this concept in a simple manner.
