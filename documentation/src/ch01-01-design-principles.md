# Design Principles
AQLARP stands for **A**ffordable **Q**uadruped **L**earning **A**nd **R**esearch **P**latform. These are the principles AQLARP is based on.
## Platform
This is the most important principle for AQLARP. AQLARP should be a solid, extendable platform, which you can use as starting point to build on and create your own amazing projects. 
Here are some of the design decisions to make AQLARP a platform:
1. Extendibility: the top, front and back are easily replaceable with your own components that suit the needs of what you are trying to create.
2. Interoperability: AQLARP makes use of [ROS2](https://ros.org) so you can easily write your own code, in any programming language you chose, that can effortlessly interact with other parts of AQLARP's codebase.
3. Well Documented: AQLARP has a good documentation to learn about AQLARP and how to extend it. Additionally AQLARP's code has clear comments to help you understand it.
## Affordable
AQLARP is relatively affordable. The parts chosen are a balance of price and how suitable they are to build a platform. Affordability does not come before making AQLARP a stable and extendable platform.
## Learning
AQLARP can be used as a learning tool. To aid in this AQLARP is well documented and extendable. Additionally AQLARP uses [ROS2](https://ros.org) which is commonly used in the robotics industry and is a valuable skill to learn.
## Research
AQLARP is extendable and it is easy to add extra sensors to measure the influence of a variety of factors. Additionally AQLARP is open source so you can change anything you want to aid in your research.
